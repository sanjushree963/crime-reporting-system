# Crime-Reporting-System
The Online crime reporting system which is a Web application designed in PHP  which aims to provide crime management solutions such as filing of FIR  and checking its status accessible to everyone

We created a website with 4 functionalities which includes login pages for user, police in charge, station in charge and police headquarters

• User can register and login and a file a complaint using Aadhar card

• The case was then assigned randomly to a police officer of the nearest police station

• The police office can update the case from the police login portal and update the status of case such as fir filed, criminal identified, criminal caught etc.

• From station in charge portal all the cases that have been to assigned to the policer officers of that station can be viewed from this portal we can also add police officers to that police station

• From headquarter portal we can add police station to different areas and view all the cases

• We also added a google map in our user portal page which detects your current location and shows you the location of nearest police station
The Crime Reporting System In PHP is a simple mini project for reporting complaints of any crimes. The project contains only the users’ side. The user can either be police or victims/complainers. The purpose of reporting complaints to the police is to get help for solving the situation or crime registered.

The users as complainers can simply register the complaint with all the details required and submit it. While the police officers can log in and manage the complaints of all users. The officers can be a head, in-charge, or normal police. This project is a very simple project that makes a convenient way for the victims to register the complaints fast and easily. They don’t have to go to the police station every time for checking the updates of their case.
